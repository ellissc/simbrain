<h1>Braitenberg Vehicles</h1>
Simbrain simulations to accompany the book <i>The Open Dynamics of Braitenberg Vehicles</i>, MIT Press, 2023, by Scott Hotton and Jeff Yoshimi.
<br><br>
(Suggest maximizing this window while reading it then minimizing when done) In this simulation you can set the weights of two Braitenberg vehicles and observe the resulting behavior. By using the sample parameters below you can produce revolving behaviors (where the two vehicles revolve around each other), translating behaviors (where they move alongside another), and various types of "meandering" behaviors where they spin while they revolve around each other or travel side by side. Other behaviors are possible, many of which are described in the book.
<br><br>
The simulation shows two vehicles, Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2. You can set the
properties of the vehicles directly in the network windows, as with any
Simbrain simulation, although this simulation is designed to make it easy for
you to reproduce the behaviors described in the book.
<br><br>
In general, set the weights directly or with the button panel, press the play button, and watch the vehicles go! If they move too far away from each other you can grab them and pull them next to each other.

<h2>The Button Panel</h2>
The button panel contains two fields labeled "left weight" and "right weight" where you can set the weights of the two vehicles, using one of the three buttons described below.  In general, pairs of positive weights create pursuers, and pairs of negative weights create avoiders.  The buttons work as follows:
<ul>
    <li><b>Same pair</b>.Takes the left and right weights in those text fields and copies them to both vehicles. Thus the two vehicles have the same pair of weights. This is a point in what we call W_same in the book.  These vehicles can pursue each other in circles or in meanders.</li>
    <li><b>Reversed pair</b>. Takes the left and right weights and applies them directly to vehicle 1, and in reverse order to vehicle 2.  Thus we have a pair of vehicles with reversed weights.  Example: vehicle 1 has weights (100,50) and vehicle 2 has weights (50,100).  This is a point in what we call W_rev in the book.  These vehicles can move side by side, sometimes while meandering or counter-rotating.</li>
    <li><b>Opposite pair</b>.Take the left and right weights and applies them directly to vehicle 1, then multiply each by -1 and applies these "opposite" values to vehicle 2.  This produces a pair of vehicles with opposite weights. These form pursuer-avoider pairs.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples</h2>
Enter the values below in the left weight and right weight fields, press the button indicated, and press run to see the corresponding behavior.
<ul>
    <li>(100, 50) and <b>Same pair</b>. Revolving behavior (attracting revolving type relative equilibrium).</li>
    <li>(100, 80) and <b>Same pair</b>. Revolving meander (attracting relative periodic orbit).</li>
    <li>(100, 50) and <b>Reversed pair</b>. Side by side behavior (attracting translating type relative equilibrium).</li>
    <li>(20, 25) and <b>Reversed pair</b>. Side by side meander (attracting translating type relative periodic orbit).</li>
    <li>(100, 50) and <b>Opposite pair</b>. Pursuer-avoider behavior.</li>
</ul>
You can see several bifurcations by setting the <b>left weight</b> to 100, and then varying the <b>right weight</b> (each time you change the number press <b>Same pair</b> and run the sim to get a feel for what happens). You can start at 75 and slowly raise the value past 80, and then past 100. The Hopf-like bifurcation occurs around 80, and at 100 we pass through W_eq (equal weights) and the vehicles change direction. Other behaviors from the book can be observed, for example around 76 we see "billiard-like" behaviors.
