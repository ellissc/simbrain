I ran along the road to catch a bus.
I ran along the road to catch the butterfly.
I walked along the road to find the deer.
I walked along the path to see the deer.
We walked along the road to search for strawberries.
We ran beside the road but got lost.
We walked beside the path but fell down.
We walked and ran along the path, but the deer found the strawberries.
I fell down the path, but the strawberries fell down.
By my green candle, I have lost my strawberries, but the deer found them.
By my green candle, the bus is a hero of our time.
By my green candle, the butterfly is a hero of our time.
Second sister went with the third brother along the path to see the deer.
